# Smart-Plant-Watering-System
A simple project done using CPP with the main objective of supplying water to plants only when the soil moisture level is low. This system minimizes manual intervention while promoting optimal plant growth.

## Overview
The plant watering system offers an automated and organized approach to watering plants by using multiple sensors. The Blynk application is used to monitor soil moisture levels in real time. The ESP32 microcontroller serves as the core component of the system, providing built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. Additional sensors such as the DHT22 sensor and soil moisture sensor are integrated to collect environmental data. A relay module acts as an actuator to control the water pump, which is powered by two 12V batteries. The pump can be operated either manually or through the Blynk application. When the soil becomes dry, the soil moisture sensor detects the moisture level, while the DHT22 sensor measures temperature and humidity. If the soil moisture value exceeds the predefined threshold of 2000, the system automatically activates the pump to water the plant.
